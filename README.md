# midi-to-gp
## Converts midi to guitar pro, Tuxguitar, 
### Thanks to (https://www.tuxguitar.app/)

* The code was taken from tuxguitar and converted to C++
* It has lots of memeory leaks, it was done in one evenning.
* On portions I used java to cpp utilities, then manual fixes until the code compiled and ran.

### Projects using it:
    * [Free online guitar tabs player](https://ghitara.com)
    * [6 coils guitar pickup](https://exicoil.from-ca.com/)
