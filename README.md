# midi-to-gp
## Converts midi to guitar pro
### Thanks to (https://www.tuxguitar.app/)

* The code was taken from tuxguitar and converted to C++
* It has lots of memory leaks, it was done in one evenning.
* On portions I used java to cpp utilities, then manual fixes until the code compiled and ran.
